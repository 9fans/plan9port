This is a port of many Plan 9 libraries and programs to Unix.

Installation
------------

To install, run ./INSTALL.  It builds mk and then uses mk to
run the rest of the installation.

For more details, see install(1), at install.txt in this directory
and at https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/man/man1/install.html.

Documentation
-------------

See https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/man/ for more documentation.
(Documentation is also in this tree, but you need to run
a successful install first.  After that, "9 man 1 intro".)

Intro(1) contains a list of man pages that describe new features
or differences from Plan 9.

Helping out
