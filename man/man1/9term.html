<p><font size=+1><b>DESCRIPTION     </b></font><br>

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=2><td><tr><td width=20><td>

    <i>9term</i> is a terminal window program for the X Window System, providing
    an interface similar to that used on Plan 9.<br>
    <p><font size=+1><b>Command     </b></font><br>
    The <i>9term</i> command starts a new window. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    The <tt><font size=+1>&#8722;a</font></tt> flag causes button 2 to send the selection immediately,
    like acme. Otherwise button 2 brings up a menu, described below.
    
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    The <tt><font size=+1>&#8722;s</font></tt> option initializes windows so that text scrolls; the default
    is not to scroll. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    The <i>font</i> argument to <tt><font size=+1>&#8722;f</font></tt> names a font used to display text, both
    in <i>9term</i>&#8217;s menus and as a default for any programs running in
    its windows; it also establishes the environment variable <tt><font size=+1>$font</font></tt>.
    If <tt><font size=+1>&#8722;f</font></tt> is not given, <i>9term</i> uses the imported value of <tt><font size=+1>$font</font></tt> if
    set; otherwise it uses the graphics system default. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    <i>9term</i> runs the given command in the window, or <tt><font size=+1>$SHELL</font></tt> if no command
    is given.<br>
    <p><font size=+1><b>Text windows    </b></font><br>
    Characters typed on the keyboard collect in the window to form
    a long, continuous document. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    There is always some <i>selected text</i>, a contiguous string marked
    on the screen by reversing its color. If the selected text is
    a null string, it is indicated by a hairline cursor between two
    characters. The selected text may be edited by mousing and typing.
    Text is selected by pointing and clicking button 1 to make a null-
    string selection, or by pointing, then sweeping with button 1
    pressed. Text may also be selected by double-clicking: just inside
    a matched delimiter-pair with one of <tt><font size=+1>{[(&lt;`'&quot;</font></tt> on the left and <tt><font size=+1>}])&gt;`'&quot;</font></tt>
    on the right, it selects all text within the pair; at the beginning
    or end of a line, it selects the line; within or at the
    edge of an alphanumeric word, it selects the word. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Characters typed on the keyboard replace the selected text; if
    this text is not empty, it is placed in a <i>snarf buffer</i> common
    to all windows but distinct from that of <a href="../man1/sam.html"><i>sam</i>(1)</a>. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Programs access the text in the window at a single point maintained
    automatically by <i>9term</i>. The <i>output point</i> is the location in the
    text where the next character written by a program to the terminal
    will appear; afterwards, the output point is the null string beyond
    the new character. The output point is also the location
    in the text of the next character that will be read (directly
    from the text in the window, not from an intervening buffer) by
    a program. Since Unix does not make it possible to know when a
    program is reading the terminal, lines are sent as they are completed
    (when the user types a newline character). 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    In general there is text in the window after the output point,
    usually placed there by typing but occasionally by the editing
    operations described below. A pending read of the terminal will
    block until the text after the output point contains a newline,
    whereupon the read may acquire the text, up to and including the
    newline. After the read, as described above, the output point
    will be at the beginning of the next line of text. In normal circumstances,
    therefore, typed text is delivered to programs a line at a time.
    Changes made by typing or editing before the text is read will
    not be seen by the program reading it. Because of the
    Unix issues mentioned above, a line of text is only editable until
    it is completed with a newline character, or when hold mode (see
    below) is enabled. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Even when there are newlines in the output text, <i>9term</i> will not
    honor reads if the window is in <i>hold mode</i>, which is indicated
    by a white cursor and blue text and border. The ESC character
    toggles hold mode. Some programs automatically turn on hold mode
    to simplify the editing of multi-line text; type ESC when done
    to allow <i>mail</i> to read the text. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    An EOT character (control-D) behaves exactly like newline except
    that it is not delivered to a program when read. Thus on an empty
    line an EOT serves to deliver an end-of-file indication: the read
    will return zero characters. The BS character (control-H) erases
    the character before the selected text. The ETB character
    (control-W) erases any nonalphanumeric characters, then the alphanumeric
    word just before the selected text. &#8216;Alphanumeric&#8217; here means
    non-blanks and non-punctuation. The NAK character (control-U)
    erases the text after the output point, and not yet read by a
    program, but not more than one line. All these
    characters are typed on the keyboard and hence replace the selected
    text; for example, typing a BS with a word selected places the
    word in the snarf buffer, removes it from the screen, and erases
    the character before the word. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    An ACK character (control-F) or Insert character triggers file
    name completion for the preceding string (see <a href="../man3/complete.html"><i>complete</i>(3)</a>). 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Text may be moved vertically within the window. A scroll bar on
    the left of the window shows in its clear portion what fragment
    of the total output text is visible on the screen, and in its
    gray part what is above or below view; it measures characters,
    not lines. Mousing inside the scroll bar moves text: clicking
    button 1
    with the mouse pointing inside the scroll bar brings the line
    at the top of the window to the cursor&#8217;s vertical location; button
    3 takes the line at the cursor to the top of the window; button
    2, treating the scroll bar as a ruler, jumps to the indicated
    portion of the stored text. Holding a button pressed in the scroll
    bar will
    cause the text to scroll continuously until the button is released.
    
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Typing down-arrow scrolls forward one third of a window, and up-arrow
    scrolls back. Typing page-down scrolls forward two thirds of a
    window, and page-up scrolls back. Typing Home scrolls to the top
    of the window; typing End scrolls to the end. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    The DEL character sends an <tt><font size=+1>interrupt</font></tt> note to all processes in
    the window&#8217;s process group. Unlike the other characters, the DEL
    and arrow keys do not affect the selected text. The left (right)
    arrow key moves the selection to one character before (after)
    the current selection. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    <i>9term</i> relies on the kernel&#8217;s terminal processing to handle EOT
    and DEL, so the terminal must be set up with EOT as the &#8220;eof&#8221;
    character and DEL as the &#8220;intr&#8221; character. <i>9term</i> runs <a href="../man1/stty.html"><i>stty</i>(1)</a>
    to establish this when the terminal is created. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Normally, written output to a window blocks when the text reaches
    the end of the screen and the terminal buffer fills; a button
    2 menu item toggles scrolling. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    <i>9term</i> changes behavior according to the terminal settings of the
    running programs. Most programs run with echo enabled. In this
    mode, <i>9term</i> displays and allows editing of the input. Some programs,
    typically those reading passwords, run with echo disabled. In
    this mode, <i>9term</i> passes keystrokes through directly,
    without echoing them or buffering until a newline character. These
    heuristics work well in many cases, but there are a few common
    ones where they fall short. First, programs using the GNU readline
    library typically disable terminal echo and perform echoing themselves.
    The most common example is the shell
    <a href="../man1/bash.html"><i>bash</i>(1)</a>. Disabling the use of readline with &#8220;<tt><font size=+1>set +o emacs</font></tt>&#8221; [<i>sic</i>]
    usually restores the desired behavior. Second, remote terminal
    programs such as <a href="../man1/ssh.html"><i>ssh</i>(1)</a> typically run with echo disabled, relying
    on the remote system to echo characters as desired. Plan 9&#8217;s <i>ssh</i>
    has a <tt><font size=+1>&#8722;C</font></tt> flag to disable this, leaving the terminal in
    &#8220;cooked&#8221; mode. For similar situations on Unix, <i>9term</i>&#8217;s button
    2 menu has an entry to toggle the forced use of cooked mode, despite
    the terminal settings. In such cases, it is useful to run &#8220;<tt><font size=+1>stty
    &#8722;echo</font></tt>&#8221; on the remote system to avoid seeing your input twice.
    
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    Editing operations are selected from a menu on button 2. The <tt><font size=+1>cut</font></tt>
    operation deletes the selected text from the screen and puts it
    in the snarf buffer; <tt><font size=+1>snarf</font></tt> copies the selected text to the buffer
    without deleting it; <tt><font size=+1>paste</font></tt> replaces the selected text with the
    contents of the buffer; and <tt><font size=+1>send</font></tt> copies the snarf buffer to
    just after the output point, adding a final newline if missing.
    <tt><font size=+1>Paste</font></tt> will sometimes and <tt><font size=+1>send</font></tt> will always place text after the
    output point; the text so placed will behave exactly as described
    above. Therefore when pasting text containing newlines after the
    output point, it may be prudent to turn on hold mode first. 
    <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr height=5><td></table>
    
    The <tt><font size=+1>plumb</font></tt> menu item sends the contents of the selection (not the
    snarf buffer) to the <i>plumber</i> (see <a href="../man1/plumb.html"><i>plumb</i>(1)</a>). If the selection
    is empty, it sends the white-space-delimited text containing the
    selection (typing cursor). A typical use of this feature is to
    tell the editor to find the source of an error by plumbing the
    file and
    line information in a compiler&#8217;s diagnostic.

    Each <i>9term</i> listens for connections on a Unix socket. When a client
    connects, the <i>9term</i> writes the window contents to the client and
    then hangs up. <i>9term</i> installs the name of this socket in the environment
    as <tt><font size=+1>$text9term</font></tt> before running <i>cmd</i>.<br>
