.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Calendar
reads the named files, default
.BR $HOME/lib/calendar ,
and writes to standard output any lines
containing today's or tomorrow's date.
Examples of recognized date formats are 
"4/11",
"April 11",
"Apr 11",
"11 April",
and
"11 Apr".
All comparisons are case insensitive.
.PP
If the
.B \-y
flag is given, an attempt is made to match on year too.  In this case,
dates of the forms listed above will be accepted if they are followed
by the current year (or last two digits thereof) or not a year â€”
digits not followed by white space or non-digits.
.PP
If the
.B \-p
flag is given, its argument is the number of days ahead to match
dates.  This flag is not repeatable, and it performs no special
processing at the end of the week.
.PP
On Friday and Saturday, events through Monday are printed.
.PP
To have your calendar mailed to you every day, use
.MR cron (8) .
