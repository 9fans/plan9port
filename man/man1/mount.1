.I mtpt
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mount
mounts a 9P server's files into the file system.
.I Servename
is typically 
either the name of a Unix domain socket
(see
.IR namespace (1))
or the name or IP address of a machine
serving 9P over TCP port 564.
.PP
.I Unmount
undoes the effects of the
.I mount
command.
.PP
9P services can be mounted on Unix systems in multiple ways.
On Linux,
.I mount
uses the native 9P kernel module when present.
Otherwise it tries to use
.IR 9pfuse (4)
with the FUSE file system module.
Using the 9P kernel module requires root access.
FUSE can often be used by regular users.
On FreeBSD,
.I mount
tries to use FUSE.
.PP
Since Unix already has a 
.I mount
command, the version described in this manual page
should be invoked as
.B 9
.BR mount .
