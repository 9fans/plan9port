.SH SYNOPSIS
.B col
[
.B -bfx 
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Col
overlays lines to expunge reverse line feeds
(ESC-7)
and half line feeds (ESC-9 and ESC-8)
as produced by
.I nroff
for .2C in
.IR ms (7)
or
.IR man (7)
and for 
.IR tbl (1).
.I Col
is a pure filter.
It normally emits only full line feeds;
option 
.B -f
(fine) allows half line feeds too.
Option 
.B -b
removes backspaces, printing just one of each pile of overstruck
characters.
.I Col
normally converts white space to tabs;
option
.B -x
overrides this feature.
Other escaped characters and non-printing characters are ignored.
.SH EXAMPLES

.L
tbl file | nroff -ms | col | p

to remove reverse line feeds, and
