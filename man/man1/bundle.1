.TH BUNDLE 1
.SH NAME
bundle \- collect files for distribution
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bundle
.I file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Bundle
writes on its standard output a shell script for
.IR rc (1)
or a Bourne shell
which, when executed,
will recreate the original
.IR files .
Its main use is for distributing small numbers of text files by
.IR mail (1).
.PP
Although less refined than standard archives from
.I 9ar
(see
.IR 9c (1))
or
.IR tar (1),
a
.IR bundle
file
is self-documenting and complete; little preparation is required on
the receiving machine.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.L
bundle mkfile *.[ch] | mail kremvax!boris
Send a makefile to Boris together with related
.L .c
and
.L .h
files.
Upon receiving the mail, Boris may save the file sans postmark,
say in
.BR gift/horse ,
then do
.TP
.L
cd gift; sh horse; mk
.SH SOURCE
.B \*9/bin/bundle
