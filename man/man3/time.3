.SH DESCRIPTION
Both
.I time
and
.I nsec
return the time since the epoch 00:00:00 GMT, Jan. 1, 1970.
The return value of the former is in seconds and the latter in nanoseconds.
For
.IR time ,
if
.I tp
is not zero then
.BI * tp
is also set to the answer.
.PP
These functions work by reading
.BR /dev/bintime ,
opening that file when
.I they
are first called.
