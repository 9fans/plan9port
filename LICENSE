===================================================================

This software is derived from Plan 9, originally copyright Lucent Technologies
and distributed under the Lucent Public License, Version 1.02.
Lucent was bought by Alcatel, which was bought by Nokia.
On March 23, 2021, Nokia announced the transfer of the Plan 9 copyrights to the
Plan 9 Foundation, which in turn relicensed Plan 9 under the the MIT license,
reproduced above.

There are a few exceptions, noted with LICENSE files in their own directories:

The bzip2 program uses the bzip2 license; see src/cmd/bzip2/LICENSE.

The fonts from Bigelow and Holmes were licensed only for Plan 9 itself,
not for derivatives like Plan 9 from User Space.

Plan 9 from User Space arranged a separate agreement with B&H to include
the bitmap fonts in the font/luc, font/lucm, font/lucsans, and font/pelm
directories. Other bitmap fonts have other licenses. See font/LICENSE.

The Lucida Sans Unicode PostScript fonts were licensed from B&H only for Plan 9
itself, not derivatives like Plan 9 from User Space. In their place, Plan 9 from
User Space provides Luxi Sans, also by B&H but available under a more liberal
license, and Deja Vu, a Unicode extension of the Bitstream Vera family of fonts.
Luxi Sans is similar to Lucida Sans, but it has no Unicode support.
Deja Vu does have good Unicode support.
