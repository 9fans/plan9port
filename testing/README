The directory hierarchy rooted in this directory contains files related
to fuzzing and other kinds of testing. The fuzz targets are meant to be
used by oss-fuzz, and are also used from regressionTestCorpora.sh.  In
the latter case no fuzzing is done, the fuzzing corpora are merely used
to test for regressions.
