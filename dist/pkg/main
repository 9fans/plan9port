 Plan 9 is a distributed computing environment built at Bell Labs 
 starting in the late 1980s. The system can be obtained from Bell Labs 
 at http://9p.io/plan9 and runs on PCs and a variety
 of other platforms.  Plan 9 became a convenient platform for 
 experimenting with new ideas, applications, and services.
 .
 Plan 9 from User Space provides many of the ideas, applications, 
 and services from Plan 9 on Unix-like systems.  It runs on FreeBSD (x86),
 Linux (x86 and PowerPC), Mac OS X (PowerPC), OpenBSD (x86), and
 SunOS (Sparc).
 .
 This is a virtual package depending on the files for a complete
