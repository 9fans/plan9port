# Security

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it
privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you
to fix the issue prior to public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be
used before a patch is released.

You may submit the report in the following ways:

- send an email to rsc@swtch.com; and/or
- send us a [private vulnerability report](https://github.com/9fans/plan9port/security/advisories/new)

Please provide the following information in your report:

- Affected programs
- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- How to reproduce the issue

This project is maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As
such, please give us at least 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure.
