# This sub-Makefile is in charge of detecting the current platform.  It sets
# the following variables:
#
#   BUILD        The configuration and system-specific directory.  Usually
#                `freetype/builds/$(PLATFORM)' but can be different for
#                custom builds of the library.
#
# The following variables must be defined in system specific `detect.mk'
# files:
#
#   PLATFORM     The detected platform.  This will default to `ansi' if
#                auto-detection fails.
#   CONFIG_FILE  The configuration sub-makefile to use.  This usually depends
#                on the compiler defined in the `CC' environment variable.
#   DELETE       The shell command used to remove a given file.
#   COPY         The shell command used to copy one file.
#   SEP          The platform-specific directory separator.
#   CC           The compiler to use.
#
# You need to set the following variable(s) before calling it:
#
#   TOP_DIR      The top-most directory in the FreeType library source
#                hierarchy.  If not defined, it will default to `.'.

# If TOP_DIR is not defined, default it to `.'
#
ifndef TOP_DIR
  TOP_DIR := .
endif

# Set auto-detection default to `ansi' resp. UNIX-like operating systems.
# Note that we delay evaluation of $(BUILD_CONFIG_), $(BUILD), and
# $(CONFIG_RULES).
#

BUILD_CONFIG_ = $(TOP_DIR)$(SEP)builds$(SEP)
BUILD         = $(BUILD_CONFIG_)$(PLATFORM)
CONFIG_RULES  = $(BUILD)$(SEP)$(CONFIG_FILE)

# We define the BACKSLASH variable to hold a single back-slash character.
# This is needed because a line like
#
#   SEP := \
#
# does not work with GNU Make (the backslash is interpreted as a line
# continuation).  While a line like
#
#   SEP := \\
#
# really defines $(SEP) as `\' on Unix, and `\\' on Dos and Windows!
