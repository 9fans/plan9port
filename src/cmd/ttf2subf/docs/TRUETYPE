How to enable the TrueType native hinter if you need it
--------------------------------------------------------

  The  TrueType  bytecode  interpreter  is disabled  in  all  public
  releases  of  the  FreeType  packages  for  patents  reasons  (see
  http://www.freetype.org/patents.html for more details).

  However, many Linux distributions do enable the interpreter in the
  FreeType packages (DEB/RPM/etc.) they produce for their platforms.
  If you are using TrueType  fonts on your system, you most probably
  want to enable it manually by doing the following:

    - open the file "include/freetype/config/ftoption.h"

    - locate a line that says:

          #undef TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER

    - change it to:

          #define TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER

    of course, this must be done _before_ compiling the library
